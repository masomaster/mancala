# App Functionality

## MVP
- As a user, I want to be able to see whose turn it is at the top of the screen.
- As a user, I want instructions at the top telling me what to do (e.g. "select a pit of stones to pick up" or "select a pit to begin placing stones")
- As a user, I want to be able to see where the pieces are so that I can choose where to start my turn
- As a user, I want to see when the game is over and who won.
- As a user, I want a reset button at the bottom so I can play again.
- As a user, I want to be able to click on a pit to pick up the stones then click on another pit to indicate where to start automatically distributing them.

## Icebox
- As a user, I want a running tally of total wins and losses per player.
- As a user, I want the app to randomly pick which player goes first for each game.
- As a user, I want to be able to pick which side of the board is mine.

# Overall UI

- Minimalist clean design or honor ancient roots?
- Board is simple
- Instructions at the top will ensure the user knows what to do.
