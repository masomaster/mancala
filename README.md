# Mancala
By Mason Lancaster

## Overview
Mancala is an ancient and global game, possibly dating back as far as the 2nd century and having hundreds of variations spanning every continent. The game involves selecting "seeds" from among various "pits," then "sowing" those seeds among the pits with the goal of accumulating the most seeds in one's own "bank." <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala" target="_blank">Read more</a><br>

## Next Steps
- âœ… Implementing responsive design
- Implementing a computer opponent
- Tweaking responsive design (pits should stay perfect circles; aspect ratio of board should remain consistent)
- Implementing delay between "sowing" the seeds in each pit
- Implementing seed images instead of words ("4 seeds")
